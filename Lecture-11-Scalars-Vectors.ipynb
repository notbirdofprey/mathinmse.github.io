    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineers and scientists are typically interested in how certain quantities vary within space.  A scalar field is a mapping of values to positions within some coordinate system.  In physical problems it is common to map values to three dimensions or fewer.  For example, scalar fields may be generated from temperature measurements within a chemical reactor, pressure data over the Earth's surface, or x-ray intensity from telescope observations.  Any mapping of a numerical quantity to a spatial coordinate is a scalar field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials engineers interested in phase transformations typically deal with scalar fields corresponding to concentration as a function of position.  This could be indicated using the symbols $c(x,y)$ where the $c$ corresponds to the field of interest and the $(x,y)$ indicating the dimensions of and position within the field."
