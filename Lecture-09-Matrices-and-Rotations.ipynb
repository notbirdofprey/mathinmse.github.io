    "\n",
    "The purpose of this laboratory is to understand and apply the concept of an agebraic group to produce one of the plane group patterns below.  In this context, algebraic groups are mathematical objects that represent a collection of geometric transformations and are used in the study of crystallography.  For example, when you say that is crystal is \"face centered cubic\" what you are really saying is that an atomic motif, when transformed by all the algebraic elements of a particular group, will be identical to the face centered cubic structure.  The group is the mathematical machinary of crystal structures.  The group itself is an abstract idea that is embodied in a crystal structure, a geometric design, a geometric series, a set of matrices, or a set of any kind where the rules that govern the set meet the criteria of a group.  The idea of a group exists beyond the example I present here."

    "## What Steps Should I Take?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Review the idea of \"symmetry operations\" and familarize yourself with mirror, translational, and rotational symmetry operations.\n",
    "1.  Review the idea of matrix transformations and how they can be used to represent symmetry operations and how those symmetry operations can be represented as a matrix/vector dot product.\n",
    "1.  Read about the metric tensor below and practice a few calculations of lengths and angles in unit cell coordinates.\n",
    "1.  Read and practice writing down 2D, 3D and 3D augmented transformation matrices and learn how Euler angles are defined.\n",
    "1.  For each case above, use a position vector pointing in a direction you select and apply a transformation using each matrix in turn.  Does the resultant vector match your anticipated transformation?  (e.g. If you take the position vector pointing at the [0,0,1] position in a cubic lattice and apply a 90 degree rotation about the x-axis, where should the resultant vector be pointing?  Repeat this for mirror planes and translations.\n",
    "1. Review the concept of a \"class\" in object oriented programming and familarize yourself with the `Point` and `Triangle` classes I have defined below.  Practice creating these objects and accessing their attributes.\n",
    "1. Review the code that accesses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and look at the `polygon` function call and the `Triangle` points method.  You can call the points method from within the polygon function to simplify the drawing of triangles.\n",
    "1.  Using the `Point` and `Triangle` classes and your knowledge of symmetry transformations, reproduce one of the plane groups from the figure below.  My suggestion is to start with a single triangle and apply a set of operations (transformation matrices) and collect new triangles into a list.  Sketch a flowchart for how you might solve this problem.\n",
    "1.  Review the very last block of code in this notebook and modify it to complete the assignment.  You will need to use combinations of translations, reflections and rotations to accomplish this.    \n",
    "1.  Prepare a new notebook (not just modifications to this one) that describes your approach to reproducing one or more of the plane groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may discover that a unique set of matrices will reproduce the whole pattern.  This small set of matrices are an algebraic structure known as a **group**.  So - the \"plane group\" is the group of symmetry operations that reproduces the structure in the plane starting from a single motif.  The plane group representations are reproduced below for reference; this image comes from Hammond's book on crystallography, cited above.\n",
    "\n",

    "Operations using vector-like data structures are an essential component of numerical computing, mathematics, science and engineering.  In the field of crystallography the use of vectors and rotations in real and reciprocal space helps to simplify the description of and quantitative operations on crystal structures.  Matrix operations are used in the solution of partial differential equations.  The vector algebra and rotations are most easily performed using matrix tools and representations.  The concepts and their mathematical properties will be reviewed and demonstrated using symbolic algebra and numerical methods.  A review of matrix algebra will be helpful."
